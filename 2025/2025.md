## [Day 1: Secret Entrance](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)

Had some issues with part 2.

## [Day 2: Gift Shop](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2)

Learned of a new module wrap from textwrap

## [Day 3: Lobby](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/3)

Utilize a stack and keep track of how many elements are removed. 

## [Day 4: Printing Department](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/4)

In first couple of attempts messed up directions coordinates. 
Key was to think there was three directions above, three directions below and one left and one right. 

## [Day 5: Cafeteria](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/5)

Part 2 was difficul tin updating list of ranges

## [Day 6: Trash Compactor](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6)

Part 2 i thought replacing spaces with '0' would be advantageous but proved to be the biggest issue with splitting and keeping its place holders. 

## [Day 7: Laboratories](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/7)

Part 2: Got help from [hyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiV7V1dTwZ8)

## [Day 8: Playground](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8)

[Distances](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/compute-distances-in-python)

## [Day 9: Movie Theater](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/9)

Part 2: Was not successfull!!!
I need to  figure out another way to solve this problem. 

Was on track with compressing grid with app2. However, I didn't account for hte spaces between which caused an error in my calculation. Following [HyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toDrFDh7VNs). Need to figure out how to optimize this.

## [Day 10: Factory](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/10)

Part 1:
Initially tried to approach with boolean value masking. This proved to be an issue for me. Watched a few different videos to try to replicate from [HyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ4dxrIfDfs) who utilized a set and [0xdf](https://youtu.be/ppQuB--h4MU?si=brLFOQZYff-g5J8A).

Part 2:
Lost on this one. Reviewed a few videos need to revsit.

## [Day 11: Reactor](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/11)

Part 2: Disaster.

Helped solving from [Jonathan Paulson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c453AH14-g) youtube.

Missing piece was using @cache to not re compute paths

## [Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/12)

I spent a lot of time just formatting the input data. Instead of trying to calculate different approaches utilized a threshold to determine fit.
