# Advent of Code Trials and Tribulations

## 2023

### [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)


Lessons Learned:


Part 1:
- Struggled properly reading txt files with split and strip. Also didn't use with context manager

Part 2:
- Initially iterated through numbers 1 to 10 to find match and replace. This created an issue where a character was shared between two strings.


### [Day 2: Cube Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

Lessons Learned:


- Still struggled with split and strip on txt files


### [Day 3: Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

Lessons Learned:

- Need to practice traversing lists of lists

### [Day 4: Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

Lessons Learned:

- My understanding of list comprehensions has drastically improved
- Implemented intersection between two sets for the first time

### [Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5)

Lessons Learned:

- I definetely overcomplicated my solution in part 1. 
- I could not solve part 2 on my own and discovered this youtube channel. [HyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino).

### [Day 6: Wait For It](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6)

Lessons Learned:

- Introduced to the [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) module. 

### [Day 7: Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

Lessons Learned:

- Implemented enums as that seemed to be the most logical option to me to create a prelimenary sort based on group. However, my understanding of sort and sorted was completely not understood. Compounding this problem was within the same groups trying to sort based on how the cards were arranged was extremely difficult.

- For part 2 my best effort was to replace the "J" with the most common value. This still gave me a lot of errors as I could not figure out the case where for all the cards in hand where "J"

### [Day 8: Haunted Wasteland](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)

Lessons Learned:

- Still didn't have the prettiest implementation of split, strip, replace.

- Part 2 was another disaster. My initial attempt was to get all values and iterate through them at the same time until the condition was met. However, after running for 5 minutes I knew this wasn't right.

- LCM, GCD, WTF? Need to revisit.

### [Day 9: Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

Lessons Learned:

- For part 2 struggled understanding how to solve the problem. For some reason I was initially thinking I would have to alternate subtracting from and then adding too the first element.
